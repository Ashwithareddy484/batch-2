synatx :-  function function_name(optional parameters,a ){ // function delclaration
                                //statements
                                }
                        function_name(arguments);

types of function:-

1.named function:- function is having a name and invoked(calling) with the same name.
2.anonymus function:- a function which doesnot have a name for it .
                    - it cannot be executed by itself.
3.function expression:- an anonymus function body is assigned as a value to the variable
                        and same function will be invoked with the same vairable.
4.IIFE(immidiate invoke function expression):- 
- it can be invoked only ont time.
5.Arrow function :- it is introduced in es6 feature.
- it concise the normal function syntax.
- ()=>{};
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.
6.Higher order function
7.callback function
-closure

es - ECMA script .
ECMA - european computer manufacturing association.
- es6 feature is stable.

explicit return :- explicitly we have to give a keyword called as "return".
explciit return is possible in both normal function as well as arrow function.
implicit return:- implicitly(by default) arrow function will take return.
